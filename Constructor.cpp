	Does not initialize the member variables to any default value . Contain garbage value after creation .
	As soon as a constructor is defined by the programmer , the compiler will no longer use this default constructor . There will be no existence of this default constructor . After this if we don't define a constructor with no parameter , we can't create an object with no argument . As compiler has forgot the default construtor .
