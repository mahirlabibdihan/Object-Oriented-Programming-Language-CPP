// In C++, there are three access specifiers:
// public - members are accessible from outside the class
// private - members cannot be accessed from outside the class
// protected - members cannot be accessed from outside the class, however, they can be accessed in inherited classes.

// Default access specifier of class is private
// Default access specifier while deriving a class is private
