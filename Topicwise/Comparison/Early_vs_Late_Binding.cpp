/*
Early binding:
1. Normal functions, overloaded functions, nonvirtual member and friend functions
2. Resolved at compile time
3. Very efficient
4. But lacks flexibility
*/

/*
Late binding:
1. Virtual functions accessed via a base class pointer
2. Resolved at run-time
3. Quite flexible during run-time
4. But has run-time overhead; slows down program execution
